# 🌙 Moon Visibility Report Generator

An AI-powered Python tool for generating **lunar visibility reports** using **LLMs (Large Language Models)** such as **Gemini**, **Groq**, and **LLaMA3** (via **Ollama**). Designed for astronomers, developers, and researchers interested in **moon sighting**, **Hilal reports**, and **Islamic calendar computations**.

## 🚀 Features

* 🧠 **AI-Powered Reporting** – Uses advanced language models to generate descriptive moon visibility reports.
* ⚡ **Parallel Processing** – Boosted performance via `ThreadPoolExecutor` for concurrent prompt generation.
* 🗃️ **Dataset Integration** – Works with structured data using `pandas`, with real-time progress updates using `tqdm`.
* 💻 **Local + Cloud Models** – Supports local models via [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and cloud APIs like **Groq**, **Gemini**, etc.
* 🛰️ **Astronomical Accuracy** – Compatible with moon phase datasets and visibility criteria for precise reports.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python (3.9+)
* `pandas`, `tqdm`, `concurrent.futures`
* Gemini / Groq API (or any chat-completion LLM)
* Ollama (for local LLaMA3 or other open models)
* FastAPI (optional, for web API interface)

## 🌐 Use Cases

* Moon visibility reporting for Islamic calendar (Hilal sighting)
* Astronomical event tracking and reporting
* Educational tools for lunar phases
* Integration into observatory or planetarium dashboards
