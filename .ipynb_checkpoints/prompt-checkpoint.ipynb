      "6. Elongation: 16° (a relatively high elongation angle, which can affect moon visibility due to the Earth's rotation and observer's position)\n",

      "* The low illumination of 1.9% suggests that the moon is not well-lit in the sky.\n",

      "* The fact that the sun is on the western horizon and the moon is relatively low in altitude (14°) means that the moon will be below the horizon soon, making it inaccessible.\n",
      "\n",

      "To determine if the Moon will be visible on 2025-03-30 00:00:00 at station Dir with a lag time of 78 minutes, we need to consider several factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Lag Time**: The lag time of 78 minutes means that the Moon's position is measured from a standard point (usually the observer) 78 minutes before the time specified. This value must be subtracted from the specified time when calculating the Moon's visibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Moon Altitude and Azimuth**: A high altitude (14° in this case) indicates that the Moon will be above the horizon, making it visible from most locations on Earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Sun Azimuth and Elongation**: The Sun's azimuth of 275° is relatively far to the west, which affects visibility by casting a shadow over part of the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **DAZ (Daily Angle of Zenith)**: A DAZ value of 1° means that the Moon will be above the horizon about 1° above the zenith. While this indicates that the Moon's top half is visible in some parts, it might not directly affect its visibility from our station.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Elongation**: The elongation of 16° suggests that the Moon appears close to the Sun in the sky at sunset but does not significantly impact its overall visibility at night.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Illumination (Fraction of illuminated area)**: An illumination of 1.9% indicates that only a small fraction of the Moon's surface is illuminated, which affects how visible it will be during the day due to solar glare but doesn't directly determine its nighttime visibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Visibility Criterion**: The given 'A' criterion might imply specific requirements for moon visibility, such as brightness or angular size above a certain threshold; without more context, we cannot precisely define what these requirements are.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that the Moon's altitude is high and it is not significantly influenced by solar glare due to its low illumination level (1.9%), the primary concern would be the Sun's presence and potential shadowing of the sky at sunrise. However, with a Sun azimuth of 275°, which means the Sun rises in the west, there's less chance for significant shadowing at our station Dir.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, under these conditions, it is likely that the Moon will be visible on 2025-03-30 00:00:00 at station Dir. The specific visibility criteria 'A' would determine if any additional considerations (such as brightness or size) affect the moon's visibility, but based on the information given, the high altitude of the Moon makes it likely to be above the horizon and thus visible during this time period.\n",
      "------------xxxxxxxx----------\n",
      "To determine if the Moon is likely to be visible on the specified date and time at the Gilgit station, we need to analyze the given parameters:\n",

      "- Date: 2025-03-30\n",
      "- Time: 00:00:00 (midnight)\n",
      "- Lag time: 78 minutes\n",
      "- Moon altitude: 14°\n",
      "- Sun azimuth: 276°\n",
      "- DAZ (Declination of Azimuth of Zenith): 1°\n",
      "- Elongation: 16°\n",
      "- Illumination: 1.9%\n",
      "- Visibility criterion: 'A'\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these parameters, let's break down the key factors affecting Moon visibility:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Moon Altitude:** The Moon is currently at an altitude of 14° above the horizon.\n",
      "2. **Visibility Criterion:** A visibility criterion of 'A' typically means that the Moon should be high enough in the sky to be visible for most people, but not so high that it becomes too close to the Sun or other bright objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are a few factors that suggest the Moon might not be fully visible at this time:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Lag Time:** A lag time of 78 minutes means that the Moon's position is actually ahead by about an hour and a half. This discrepancy suggests that the Moon may not be in its typical visible phase (first quarter, full moon, etc.) as it appears on the chart.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Sun Azimuth:** With a sun azimuth of 276° at midnight, the Sun rises almost due East. Given this and the DAZ being only 1°, there is limited sky available for Moon visibility without considering high altitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The Moon's altitude might be sufficient to make it visible given typical conditions.\n",
      "- However, with a lag time indicating that its actual position is ahead by an hour and a half, and low azimuth due to the rising Sun, the Moon would likely not be in the \"A\" visibility category due to its position relative to the Sun and horizon.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering these factors, it's unlikely that the Moon will be fully visible on 2025-03-30 at 00:00:00 at the Gilgit station given the Moon's apparent position is ahead by an hour and a half, which would suggest it's in its next phase rather than a typical full moon or new moon. The combination of this lag time and low azimuth relative to the rising Sun might prevent it from reaching 'A' visibility criterion without additional factors being considered (like atmospheric conditions) that could make it partially visible.\n",
      "------------xxxxxxxx----------\n",
      "To determine if the moon is likely to be visible on 2025-03-30 at 00:00:00 at station Islamabad with the given conditions, we need to consider several factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Moon Altitude**: The moon's altitude of 14° above the horizon is relatively low for visibility. A higher altitude would make it easier to see.\n",
      "2. **Lag Time**: With a lag time of 76 minutes, the moon will be in the western sky at 00:00:00. This means that any obstruction between the observer and the moon (such as trees or buildings) could block the view if they are in the way.\n",
      "3. **Sun Azimuth**: The sun's azimuth is set to 275°, which suggests that the station is located in a region with a high solar declination angle. However, this doesn't directly impact the visibility of the moon.\n",
      "4. **DAZ (Day-Azimuth**: DAZ is not a standard term in astronomy or astrometry. Assuming it refers to the day's azimuth, which isn't relevant here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these conditions:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The moon is at a relatively low altitude of 14° above the horizon, making it difficult to see without some obstruction.\n",
      "- The lag time means that if there are obstacles between the observer and the moon's path in the sky, they could block visibility.\n",
      "- Without knowing more about the specific location or any intervening obstructions, we can't definitively say if the moon is visible based solely on these parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, considering typical conditions for lunar observations:\n",
      "\n",
      "If Islamabad was not obstructed by other features and assuming there were no atmospheric conditions affecting visibility (such as heavy haze), it's reasonable to assume that the moon would be partially or fully visible.\n",
      "------------xxxxxxxx----------\n",
      "Based on the provided data, I'll analyze the conditions for the moon's visibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "The visibility criterion is set as 'A', which means the moon needs to meet at least two out of five specific conditions to be considered visible:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The lunar altitude must exceed 7°.\n",
      "2. The elongation angle must be less than or equal to 12°.\n",
      "3. The illumination percentage must be greater than 1%.\n",
      "4. The DAZ (Diameter-Azimuthal-zenith) should not exceed a certain threshold, but this value is not explicitly provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the data:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Lunar altitude: 14°\n",
      "* Elongation angle: 16°\n",
      "* Illumination percentage: 1.9%\n",
      "* Visibility criterion 'A'\n",
      "\n",
      "The lunar altitude (14°) exceeds the required minimum of 7°, so it satisfies one condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the elongation angle is higher than the recommended maximum (12°), which might not allow for a clear view of the moon due to its angular proximity to the sun. \n",
      "\n",
      "The illumination percentage (1.9%) is greater than the minimum, but we need more data about the DAZ threshold value and how it interacts with these conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on these factors, I would say that the moon's visibility might be limited or uncertain due to the elongation angle being quite high for a criterion 'A'. However, without explicit details on the DAZ threshold or further information about the lunar position at sunrise/sunset, it's difficult to make a definitive assessment of visibility.\n",
      "------------xxxxxxxx----------\n",
      "To determine if the moon is likely to be visible on 2025-03-30 00:00:00 at station Karachi with the given conditions, let's analyze each parameter:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Moon Altitude: 14° - This is a relatively high altitude, indicating that the moon should be above the horizon.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Lag Time: 70 minutes - A lag time of 70 minutes means that the moon was visible 70 minutes before the specified time. In this case, it would have been visible around 23:50:00.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Sun Azimuth: 275° - The sun's azimuth is measured from north. An azimuth of 275° means the sun is in the west-southwest direction at sunrise, but since we are looking at moon visibility after sunset, this value does not directly influence our ability to see the moon.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. DAZ (-2°): This parameter might seem relevant if considering specific rules or guidelines for observing celestial bodies. However, without more context on what \"DAZ\" specifically refers to in relation to lunar visibility, its relevance is unclear.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Elongation: 16° - The elongation of the moon indicates how far it has moved eastward relative to the sun. An elongation of 16° means the moon was relatively close to being between the sun and the observer's horizon at sunset but since we're after sunset, this doesn't directly affect visibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Illumination: 1.9% - This parameter is usually related to the amount of direct sunlight that falls on the Earth's surface due to lunar eclipses or other solar phenomena. A very low illumination percentage suggests a deep shadow environment, which could be critical in determining moon visibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Visibility Criterion 'A': Without specific guidelines for what \"A\" means in this context, it's challenging to accurately assess the moon's visibility based solely on this criterion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering these parameters:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The high moon altitude and relatively recent sunset (given the lag time) suggest that the moon was above the horizon.\n",
      "- Low illumination percentage could imply an environment with deep shadows or heavy atmospheric conditions, which might affect visibility.\n",
      "- Without clear information about what \"DAZ\" refers to or how it influences moon visibility, its impact is unclear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these factors and the lack of specificity regarding \"A\", without further context on visibility criteria that specifically apply to lunar observation (\"A\"), we cannot confidently conclude if the moon would be visible based solely on this information. Lunar visibility can be heavily influenced by atmospheric conditions such as fog, haze, pollution, and the observer's location relative to light sources (sun or artificial light) which are not fully specified here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, given the lack of detailed context regarding \"DAZ\" and the specific criteria \"A\", we cannot definitively say if the moon is visible on 2025-03-30 00:00:00 at station Karachi.\n",
      "------------xxxxxxxx----------\n",
      "To determine if the moon is likely to be visible on that specific date and time at a particular location, we need to consider several factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Moon Altitude: The moon's altitude of 14° suggests that it should be above the horizon for most of the day.\n",
      "2. Sun Azimuth: With a sun azimuth of 275°, the sun is in the southeast, which means the moon will be in the northwest. This could potentially block the view of the moon at times.\n",
      "3. DAZ (Day-Azimuth-Zenith): A DAZ of 0° indicates that the sun and moon are in the same direction, which suggests that the moon should be relatively easy to see during this time.\n",
      "4. Elongation: The elongation of 16° is significant, as it implies that the moon is relatively far from the sun, making it more visible at night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering these factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The moon's altitude of 14° indicates it will be above the horizon for most of the day, suggesting it should be visible.\n",
      "- Sun and Moon alignment in DAZ indicates visibility with minimal obstruction during this time.\n",
      "- Illumination level (1.9%) is low but considering lunar illumination generally varies greatly throughout a month and sometimes even within a single night depending on the phase, such a relatively low percentage could still make the moon appear bright enough to see at night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these conditions, it's likely that the moon will be visible in the sky around 2025-03-30 at station Lahore.\n",

      "- Sun azimuth: 275°, which indicates that the sun is almost due west\n",
      "- DAZ (Dusk-Au-Dawn) time: 1°, which means that the horizon is at 1° above or below the horizon for sunrise and sunset respectively. However since it's midnight there will be no solar activity so we can disregard this information.\n",

      "- Illumination: 1.9%\n",
      "- Visibility criterion: 'A'\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these conditions, I would say that the moon is very likely to be visible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's why:\n",
      "\n",

Given the lag time of 73 minutes, the moon is expected to be high enough in the sky to be visible by around 01:20:00.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Moon altitude 14°**: The moon's altitude determines how much of it is above the horizon and can be seen from a particular location. With an altitude of 14°, the entire disk of the moon should be above the horizon, making it easily visible to the naked eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Sun azimuth 275°**: The sun's position affects the visibility of celestial objects like the moon. If the sun is too high in the sky (greater than 90°), it may block or obstruct the view of the moon. In this case, the sun is at an azimuth of 275°, which is relatively low on the horizon.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **DAZ -1°**: DAZ refers to the Moon's Direction Angle Zone. If the Moon is in the zone corresponding to a negative value (in this case, -1 degree), it means that the Moon will not be visible above the horizon for at least part of the night because of its position relative to the Earth and Sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Elongation 16°**: Elongation measures how far away from the Sun the moon appears in the sky. An elongation greater than 10° can make the moon visible at night, but an elongation less than 4° typically indicates that it will not be visible because of the low angle relative to the horizon.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Illumination 1.9%**: This value is related to how much sunlight illuminates the object from the Sun's perspective. In this case, illumination is very low (1.9%), which suggests that the moonlight should be quite faint and not significantly impact the overall brightness of the night sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Visibility criterion 'A'**: Criteria like 'A', 'B', or other letters often relate to how much of the celestial body can be seen above the horizon, with higher numbers indicating more of the object is visible. However, without further specifics on the criterion for 'A', it's challenging to assess its direct impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The moon will appear relatively high in the sky enough to be visible by around 01:20:00.\n",
      "- The sun's position is low enough not to obstruct the view of the moon.\n",
      "- However, the moon's elongation relative to the horizon indicates it might not be fully above the horizon for much of the night because of its DAZ and apparent angle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering these points, while there are conditions that suggest visibility like a high altitude and relatively low sun azimuth, the primary factor preventing full visibility is likely due to its position in the sky (low elongation relative to the horizon) which could limit its appearance above the horizon for some time before it rises sufficiently. Therefore, without direct visual confirmation, we can't conclude with absolute certainty that the moon will be fully visible throughout its predicted rise and set times at station Multan on 2025-03-30 00:00:00 based solely on these conditions.\n",
      "------------xxxxxxxx----------\n",
      "To determine if the moon is likely to be visible on that specific date and time at station Muzaffarabad, we can analyze the given parameters:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Lag time of 77 minutes: This suggests that the moon has not yet reached its highest point in the sky for that day.\n",
      "- Moon altitude 14°: The moon's altitude above the horizon is relatively low, which might limit its visibility due to the surrounding terrain or obstructions.\n",
      "- Sun azimuth 275°: The sun's position in the sky indicates it is in the western part of the sky. This placement suggests that any light reflected from the moon will be at an angle that could make it harder for observers on the ground to see the moon, as the direct path from the moon would require looking at it with the sun in its field of view.\n",
      "- DAZ 1°: The DAZ (Day-Azimuth) value is very small, indicating that the azimuth of sunrise and sunset are nearly perpendicular. This indicates that dawn and dusk have a minimal effect on atmospheric conditions and light pollution relative to day values.\n",
      "- Elongation 16°: The elongation refers to how far away the moon is from the sun at this point in its orbit. While it can affect visibility due to changes in illumination, the moon's position at 16° elongation would likely be visible with a small amount of scattered light on clear nights.\n",
      "- Illumination 1.9%: The illumination level suggests that only a very small percentage of the moon's illuminated surface is visible from the ground. However, given the relatively low moon altitude and considering that even minimal illumination can sometimes make objects like stars more noticeable due to contrast with background sky brightness or even visibility of reflected light during the day in the right conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these parameters:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Visibility Criterion 'A'**: This criterion usually indicates that there are some atmospheric effects affecting the visibility, such as scattering (as implied by a low illumination percentage), but it doesn't rule out any objects from being visible entirely if they can be seen against the sky's background brightness.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Moon Visibility Under Normal Conditions**: In normal conditions, with the moon at higher altitudes and having more direct sunlight reflecting off its surface onto the ground (especially when illuminated significantly and not too close to sunrise or sunset), visibility of the moon should be good.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **The Effects of Elongation on Visibility**: Even though the moon is 16° elongated from the sun, this might still allow it to be visible if there's enough contrast between its illuminated surface (even with a low illumination level) and the background brightness, especially against darker or clearer night sky conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering these factors and assuming clear skies without significant obstructions near Muzaffarabad on that date and time, **the moon is likely to be visible**. However, its visibility might not be optimal due to its relatively low altitude in the sky, suggesting it may appear smaller than usual when viewed from the ground, or possibly requiring more precise viewing conditions for full observation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep in mind this explanation assumes standard weather conditions (clear skies) and no significant obstructions near Muzaffarabad on that date. Actual visibility can be influenced by local topography, pollution levels, moon phase, and other atmospheric factors.\n",

      "To determine if the moon will be visible on 2025-03-30 00:00:00 at station Peshawar with the given conditions, we need to analyze the provided information:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Lag time of 77 minutes: This indicates that the moon is about 77 minutes behind the sun in its position in the sky.\n",
      "2. Moon altitude 14°: The moon's altitude from the horizon is relatively low, indicating it may be near or below the horizon.\n",
      "3. Sun azimuth 275°: The sun is located at an angle of 275° relative to true north, which suggests a very high point on the horizon, making it difficult for the moon to be visible if it's lower in altitude than the sun.\n",
      "4. DAZ (Daily Altitude Zero) 1°: This indicates that the moon's highest point above the horizon is only 1 degree from the zenith (directly overhead). A higher DAZ would indicate a brighter or more elevated moon, making it potentially visible if other conditions are favorable.\n",
      "5. Elongation 16°: The elongation refers to the distance between the sun and the moon in the sky. This value of 16° suggests that the moon is relatively close to its ascending node (where it rises due east) but still quite high in the sky, which could make it visible if there are no obstructions.\n",
      "6. Illumination 1.9%: This indicates the relative brightness of the moon compared to the sun, with higher values meaning a brighter moon. A value of 1.9% suggests that the moon is quite faint and might not be easily seen in this scenario.\n",
      "7. Visibility criterion 'A': Criterion 'A' typically refers to a condition where the moon should be at least 50° above the horizon for it to be considered visible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering these factors, on 2025-03-30 00:00:00 at station Peshawar with a lag time of 77 minutes, moon altitude 14°, and all other conditions specified:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The moon's low altitude (14°) and proximity to the sun's high point in the sky make it difficult for the moon to be visible above the horizon.\n",
      "* Given that the moon is only about 1 degree above the DAZ line, which indicates a relatively low elevation, it may not meet the visibility criterion 'A'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on these factors, it appears that the conditions might be unfavorable for observing the moon on this date. However, lunar observations are influenced by local obstructions and other environmental factors, which can impact moon visibility even under optimal conditions.\n",
      "------------xxxxxxxx----------\n",
      "To determine if the moon is likely to be visible on 2025-03-30 at station Quetta with the given conditions, let's analyze the data:\n",

      "* Moon altitude: 14° - A relatively high altitude angle for a lunar observation, suggesting the moon should be visible above the horizon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these data points and other parameters such as sun azimuth (275°), DAZ (-1°), elongation (16°), illumination (1.9%), and the visibility criterion 'A', we can make an assessment of whether the moon is likely to be observable from Quetta on 2025-03-30.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided data:\n",
      " \n",
      " The sun's azimuth is at 275°, which means it will be in a high position in the sky. This typically affects the visibility of celestial objects due to the bright light dominating the horizon and potentially overpowers fainter objects like the moon.\n",
      " \n",
      " Given that DAZ (Decanacular Azimuth) is -1°, and elongation is 16°, while illumination is at 1.9%, these parameters do suggest a possible scenario where the moon might still be visible under optimal conditions, considering they don't completely overshadow the visibility criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      " Therefore, based on the given data, it seems likely that the moon would be observable from Quetta on 2025-03-30, provided the sun's position doesn't interfere with the moon's visibility and assuming there are no other adverse weather or atmospheric conditions affecting observations.\n",

      "1. Illumination: The amount of sunlight reflecting off the moon's surface.\n",

      "\n",

      "Moon's azimuth: $275^\\circ$\n",
      "Sun's azimuth: 1°\n",
      "\n",
      "So the sun would need to be in a position where it is at least one degree behind or before moon's azimuth, if the moon were directly above the observer. The sun has an azimuth of $1^\\circ$ but the moon has an azimuth of $275^\\circ$, indicating that when the sun is below the horizon (in this case, we can't see its position) there should be enough room for the sun to not completely obstruct our view of the moon.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a low illumination value of 1.9% and an elongation angle of 16° at 0 o'clock (00:00), even with these values, it's likely that the Moon will still be visible from Swabi station on 2025-03-30.\n",
